## Welcome! I'm **Spencer T. Gardner**, a fisheries biologist and researcher specializing in **fish recruitment dynamics**, **ecosystem modeling**, and **climate change impacts on aquatic ecosystems**. I’m currently a Biophysical Modeling Analyst with the [Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research](https://ciglr.seas.umich.edu), collaborating with NOAA GLERL and other partners to advance science for the Great Lakes and beyond.

### 🎓 **Background**
- **Ph.D. in Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences** (Purdue University - West Lafayette, IN)
  - Dissertation: *Modeling approaches to understand fish recruitment in lage lake ecosystems*
- **M.S. in Marine Biology** (University of North Carolina Wilmington - Wilmington, NC)
  - Thesis: *Ecological mechanisms generating variable first year growth and recruitment in juvenile southern flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma)*
- **B.S. in Fisheries, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology** (North Carolina State University - Raleigh, NC)
<br><br>

### 💻 **My Research Interests**
- 🌊 **Large Lake Ecosystems**: Investigating physical and biological drivers of fish recruitment, particularly in the Laurentian Great Lakes.
- 🌎 **Climate Change Impacts**: Studying adaptive capacity and resilience of fish populations under changing environmental conditions.
- 🐟 **Fisheries Management**: Developing tools for ecosystem-based management in freshwater and marine systems.
- 🗺️ **Modeling and Visualization**: Leveraging hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models to understand larval transport, early life experiences, habitat connectivity, growth and survival.
<br><br>

### 🛠️ **Skills**
- ⌨️ **Programming**: Python, R, Interactive Data Language (IDL)
- 💾 **Data Analysis**: Statistical and mechanistic modeling, and spatial analysis
- 🥽**Modeling Frameworks**: Individual-based modeling, Lagrangian particle dispersion, hydrodynamic simulations, fish bioenergetics, ecosystem modeling
<br><br>

### 🎒 **Current Projects**
- **Fish Recruitment in Large Lakes**, **Adaptive Capacity of Aquatic Ecosystems**, **Biophysical Modeling**
